{-| This is a library of _fuzzers_ you can use to supply values to your fuzz
tests. You can typically pick out which ones you need according to their types.

A `Fuzzer a` knows how to create values of type `a`. It can create them randomly,
so that your test's expectations are run against many values. Fuzzers will often
generate edge cases likely to find bugs. If the fuzzer can make your test fail,
the test runner also knows how to "simplify" that failing input into more minimal
examples, some of which might also cause the tests to fail. In this way, fuzzers
can usually find the simplest input that reproduces a bug.


## Common Fuzzers

@docs int, intRange, float, floatRange, percentage, string, bool, maybe, result, list, listOfLength, listOfLengthBetween, array


## Working with Fuzzers

@docs Fuzzer, oneOf, oneOfValues, constant, map, map2, map3, map4, map5, andMap, frequency, frequencyValues, andThen, filter


## Tuple Fuzzers

Instead of using a tuple, consider using [`fuzz2`][fuzz2] or [`fuzz3`][fuzz3].

@docs pair, triple


## Uncommon Fuzzers

@docs char, unit, order, invalid, weightedBool

{-| The representation of fuzzers is opaque. Conceptually, a `Fuzzer a` consists
of a way to randomly generate values of type `a` in a way allowing the test runner
to simplify those values.

{-| A fuzzer for the unit value. Unit is a type with only one value, commonly
used as a placeholder.
-}
unit : Fuzzer ()
unit =

{-| A fuzzer for boolean values. It's useful when building up fuzzers of complex
types that contain a boolean somewhere.

We recommend against writing tests fuzzing over booleans. Write a unit test for
the true and false cases explicitly.

TODO ~janiczek: I'm not sure I even agree with this ^. What if you want to
fuzz-test some invariant over the whole "input space" of a function, and you
don't care what the boolean argument is?

Simplifies in order `False < True`.

-}
bool : Fuzzer Bool
bool =
    oneOfValues [ False, True ]


{-| A fuzzer for order values.

Simplifies in order `LT < EQ < GT`.

-}
order : Fuzzer Order
order =
    oneOfValues [ LT, EQ, GT ]


{-| A fuzzer for int values. It will never produce `NaN`, `Infinity`, or
`-Infinity`.

This fuzzer will generate values in the range `Random.minInt .. Random.maxInt`,
but it will also try generating in the range `-(2^32) .. 2^32`. No guarantees
though!

Simplifies towards 0; prefers positive values over negative ones.

-}
int : Fuzzer Int
int =
    intRange (negate 0xFFFFFFFF) 0xFFFFFFFF


{-| A fuzzer for int values between a given minimum and maximum value,
inclusive. Shrunken values will also be within the range.

Remember that [Random.maxInt](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Random#maxInt)
is the maximum possible int value, so you can do `intRange x Random.maxInt` to get all
the ints x or bigger.

{-| Create a new `Fuzzer` by providing a list of probabilistic weights to use
with other fuzzers.
For example, to create a `Fuzzer` that has a 1/4 chance of generating an int
between -1 and -100, and a 3/4 chance of generating one between 1 and 100,
you could do this:

    Fuzz.frequency
        [ ( 1, Fuzz.intRange -100 -1 )
        , ( 3, Fuzz.intRange 1 100 )
        ]

This fuzzer will simplify towards the fuzzers earlier in the list (each of which
will also apply its own way to simplify the values).

There are a few circumstances in which this function will return an invalid
fuzzer, which causes it to fail any test that uses it:

  - If you provide an empty list of frequencies
  - If any of the weights are less than 0
  - If the weights sum to 0

Be careful recursively using this fuzzer in its arguments. Often using `map`
is a better way to do what you want. If you are fuzzing a tree-like data
structure, you should include a depth limit so to avoid infinite recursion, like
so:

    type Tree
        = Leaf
        | Branch Tree Tree

    tree : Int -> Fuzzer Tree
    tree i =
        if i <= 0 then
            Fuzz.constant Leaf

        else
            Fuzz.frequency

`frequency` will automatically switch to this function if used with integers

{-| Use a generated value to decide what fuzzer to use next.

For example, let's say you want to generate a list of given length.
One possible way to do that is first choosing how many elements will there be
(generating a number), `andThen` generating a list with that many items:

    Fuzz.int 1 10
        |> Fuzz.andThen
            (\length ->
                let

                    go todo acc =
                        if todo <= 0 then
                            constant (List.reverse acc)

                        else

                                |> Fuzz.andThen (\item -> go (length - 1) (item :: acc))
                in
                go length []
            )

(By the way, it will probably be better to just use one of the [`list`](#list)
helpers in this module.)

Think of it as a generalization of [`map`](#map). Inside [`map`](#map) you don't
have the option to fuzz another value based on what you already have; inside
`andThen` you do.
